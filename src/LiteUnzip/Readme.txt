This directory contains the source code, and Microsoft Visual
C++ (4.0 or better) project files, to create the LiteUnzip.DLL
file. This is the DLL that contains functions to extract (ie, unzip)
the contents of a ZIP archive.

For Linux, run the "makefile" with GNU's make. For Windows, open
the LITEUNZIP.mdp Visual Studio Workspace.

When testing the examples, it is assumed that you will copy the DLL
and .LIB files to the "Zip" root directory.
